<p>
Summer is my favorite season of the year, not only because my birthday falls right in the middle of it, but because all of my friends are
home from school, there's summer baseball games and concerts, the weather is great, and we are exam and homework free!
</p>
<p>
Because I live so close to a lake where all my friends have boats, I spend most of my time (when I'm not working) tubing, jet skiing,
and just relaxing in the <i>temporarily</i> beautiful weather. I work with a lot of my friends during the summer
so it doesn't make going to work as bad as it is for some people. This past summer I learned to wake board, with MANY
attempts that were not successful, and few that were. 
</p>

<p>
Every year I look forward to summer the most because soon enough I won't be able to do all the fun and care-free
things that I do now as I'm young.
