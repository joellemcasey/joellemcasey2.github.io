<h1> 1, 2, 3 Strikes You're Out! </h1>
<h2> Balancing academics, games, and practices... While trying to live a normal young adult life. </h2>

<p>
As a sophomore I transferred to Saint Joseph's College of Maine primarily so I could play on a college softball team. Although it was
very difficult to leave all my friends I had made here at UMaine, I knew in the end playing the sport I loved would make me happy. 
</p>
<p>
However most people really don't think a lot about how stressful it is balancing a sport and your academics. There were countless nights
where I would be coming home from away games praying that the WIFI on our bus would speed up so I could get my homework done before we
arrived back on campus.... along with all my other teammates. As well as balancing everything, trying to find time to actually 
enjoy college, eat right, and get good sleep was very difficult. 
</p>
<p>
As much as I loved my teammates and playing a sport with a group of girls, I decided to focus more on my academics
because I felt that, that is what's most important in the long run.
