<p> Hi! My name is Duke Casey and I am six months old! I was born with seven other brothers and sisters, but we all got sent to different forever homes. When I was really young
I got very sick and almost died, but with the help of my mom and my vet I was able to survive!</p>

<p> My favorite toy is my stuffed animal pig that squeaks, and I <B>LOVE</B> when my mom gives me beef jerky for dogs when I am a good boy. 
I am still working on not jumping on humans when I get excited to see them because if I do I get sprayed with water. I am such a happy puppy, and I love meeting new furry friends and human

<p> A typical day for me is waking up with my mom, eating my breakfast, then sleeping or playing with my stuffed animal pig!
Then my mom usually leaves for school and then she will give me some treats when she comes home. I really look forward to my dinner,
but that doesn't usually come until night time. My friend Sugar lives in the apartment across from me,
so I will go and play with her sometimes. She is black as well!
</p>
